// GOOGLE
// The following functions allow for Google login authenitcation onto the web application. 
//They work with the Google-auth-library module so that the server successfuly communicates with the Google API.
//The user signs in with their Google account, the server captures their ID token, name and email details.  
//This allows the user to access the web application, and sign out whenebver they would like. 

//The onSignIn function occurs when the user clicks on the Google Sign In button on the index page of the application. 
//It communicates with the Google Authenitcation library so that the user can enter their Google email and password- information is sent to the backend server and the console.
//This function also shows the "continue to application" link which directs the user to the next page of the app. The 'Sign Out' button also appears after the user signs in.
//The callServer() function is also called here- this function will be discussed down below.
